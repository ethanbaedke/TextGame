# SCHWARTZVILLE

# PROMPT: Fantasy middle-class human village on open plains, timber-framed houses with thatched and tiled roofs, cobblestone streets, golden grass fields in the distance, smoke rising from chimneys, people working and talking, warm lighting, grounded fantasy atmosphere, high detail, fantasy concept art style.

echo "A tidy village sits nestled among the open plains, its timber-framed homes and cobbled paths radiating quiet industry."
echo "Smoke drifts lazily from chimneys, and the air hums with the sounds of trade, gossip, and clinking tools."
echo "Modest yet proud, the villagers thrive between golden fields and the open sky, rooted in tradition and neighborly strength."
